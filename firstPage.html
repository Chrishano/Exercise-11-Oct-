    <u><h1>Hobbies</h1></u>

    <u><h2>Forex</h2></u>
    <p>I do forex as a hobby to help create more passive income and i do think this would be a good skill to have especially for investing.</p>

    <u><h2>Researching</h2></u>
    <p>I like to do a lot of research in my spare time to learn new things and to find updates with the world. Its more like self-learning plus I gain more knowledge.</p>

    <u><h1>Goals</h1></u>

    <u><h2>Financial Freedom</h2></u>
    <p>My goal is finanial freedom because I have a fear that I might not move far in life when I get to an older age.</p>

    <u><h2>Succession</h2></u>
    <p>I really just want to succeed in life and I know my hobbies would help me reach my goals.</p>
